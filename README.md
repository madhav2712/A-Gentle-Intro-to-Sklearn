Welcome to A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning Using SciKit-Learn

This Documentation focuses on a specific sub-field of machine learning called predictive modeling.

This is the type of machine learning that the scikit-learn library in Python was desinged for. 

Predictive modeling is focused on developing models that make accurate predictions at the expense of explaining why predictions are made. 

You and I don't need to be able to write a binary classification model. We need to know how to use and interpret the results of the model. 


Where does machine learning fit into data science?

Data science is a much broader discipline. 

Data Scientists take the raw data, analyse it, connect the dots and tell a story often via several visualizations. They usually have a broader range of skill-set and may not have too much depth into more than one or two. They are more on the creative side. Like an Artist. An Engineer, on the other hand, is someone who looks at the data as something they have to take in and churn out an output in some appropriate form in the most efficient way possible. The implementation details and other efficiency hacks are usually on the tip of their fingers. There can be a lot of overlap between the two but it is more like A Data Scientist is a Machine Learning Engineer but not the other way round. -- Ria Chakraborty, Data Scientist
